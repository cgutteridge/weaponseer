Number of Attacks: reroll?

better colour coding 

Hit: RR1,RR,Sustained,Crit,Lethal

Wound: RR1, RR, Devestating, Crit, -1AC, -if S higher than T

option to set decimal places

Bug: if damage is certain, the cumulative odds go weird.

Notes:
Damage from devastating wounds is applied as if it were just a bypass to saves NOT saved until the end of all attacks (as technically it is mortal wounds) as nobody actually does that
